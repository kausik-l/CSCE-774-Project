# Robotic Manipulation and Causal Structure Learning (CSCE 774 Project)

This project is part of the coursework for **CSCE 774: Robotics**, focused on exploring causal structure and transfer learning in robotic manipulation using the **CausalWorld** benchmark.

The work is based on the paper:  
> Ahmed, Ossama, et al. *"CausalWorld: A robotic manipulation benchmark for causal structure and transfer learning."* arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.04296 (2020).

The goal of this project was to implement experiments using the CausalWorld framework, understand the role of causality in robotic task generalization, and evaluate transfer performance under varying task conditions.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `code/` — I created custom tasks and also ran a few basic experiments (from the paper).
- `trained_models/` — Saved models, logs, and results.
- `report/` — My project report.
- `README.md` — This file.

## 🔧 Environment Setup

The project was developed using Python 3.8 and the [CausalWorld](https://github.com/rr-learning/CausalWorld) framework.

### Installation Steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/kausik-l/CSCE-774-Project.git.
2. Set up environment: conda create --name <env_name> --file requirements.txt.
3. You are now ready to run any of the Python files in the 'code/'.
